<h2 class="backcolor"><u>Pets in Islam</u></h2>
			<p>Animals are allowed in islam as pets and beasts of burden. Many Sahaba used to keep animals like dogs for hunting and protection.
			They would keep cats for companionship. But there are rules in islam against having dogs. This is because they are made out Shaytanâ€™s spit.
			Therefore they are not allowed inside the house. We are allowed however to keep birds and trim their feathers, Abu Hurayra used to do this.
			As muslims we can keep and tame animals like horses and camels to do hard labor for us.(5)</p>
