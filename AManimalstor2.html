<h2 class="backcolor"><u>Animals in Islamic Stories prt.2</u></h2>
			<p>Another famous example of animals in islamic stories is the story of surah al feel. In this story an evil king 
			who wanted to destroy the kaaba. He had an army of elephants and he set out towards makkah. But, when the elephants got 
			close, they refused to attack the kaaba. Then Allah sent a very large amount of birds to stone the whole army. 
			As it says at 105/5 “Leaving them like chewed up leaves”. One last story is the story of Prophet Yunus. 
			Prophet Yunus was trying to leave his people and went on a boat. The boat capsized in a storm and a whale swallowed the Prophet.
			Prophet Yunus then spent his time in the whale asking for forgiveness from Allah for leaving his people. Eventually the whale 
			spit him out on the beach. He then thanked Allah for releasing him and went back to his people.(6)<br>
