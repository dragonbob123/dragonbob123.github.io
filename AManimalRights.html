<h2 class="backcolor"><u>Animals Rights in Islam</u></h2>
			<p>Islam strongly asks Muslims to treat animals with compassion and not to abuse them. The Holy Qurâ€™an states that all creation praises 
			God in their own language. Prophet Muhammad often chastised his Companions who mistreated animals, and spoke to them about the need for mercy 
			and kindness. It is haram to kill animals for sport or to kill an animal without there being a good reason for it (such as self defence). 
			In the quran, Allah says that it is haram for humans to hunt animals unless they need the food. Eid al Adha is a celebration where muslims sacrifice animals.
			It is not necessary to sacrifice animals but it is a sunnah.(2)</p>
