		<h2 class="backcolor"><u>Animals in Islamic Stories</u></h2>
			<p>One of the most famous stories in Islam that involves animals, in this case the spider. The story takes place 
			when prophet muhammed was trying to run away to madina and he and his companion Abu Bakr hid in a cave late at night. 
			One of the best trackers in Arabia was following him. The tracker and his team followed the Prophet and Abu Bakr to the 
			cave where they hid. Meanwhile a spider had made a web in front of the cave entrance and doves nested at the front of the cave. 
			This gave the cave an abandoned look and the tracker and his group moved on. Another story of how Animals helped Prophets was in the story 
			of Prophet Ibraheem and the ram. Prophet Ibrahim was commanded by Allah to sacrifice his own son, when he went to do this however, 
			he found himself slaughtering a ram. Allah had send the ram in place of ibrahim so his son didnâ€™t have to die.(6)</p>
